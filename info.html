        <P>
            When I came to know about the Chaupar and how it is one of the most traditional board game of India;  <br>
            I became curious to know about the history and it's related interesting incidents in the past. <br>
            From which I came to know about the during the period of <em>Mahabharata</em> there was a very 
            <br> important incident
            that happend.

            During the <em>Mahabharata</em> Yudishthira a character in it loses his wife during the course of the board game. <br>
            Which in turn, become the cause of the <em>Mahabharata</em>. 
            Moreover, with the help of this game <br> and a series of events human nature is highlighted that how in order to get the power br
            people can do anything; which is the harsh reality of today's society as well.
        </P>

            There are also some traits that shows that this <em>LORD SHIVA</em> was also fond of playing this game and he used to 
            play it with his wife <em> Goddess Parvati</em>

    <h2>
        <em>
            Rules while playing Chaupar
        </em>

    <p>
        <div>
            <p>
                Since, all games have some basic rules to play them so do the Chaupar. These are discussed below:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Three long dice are required. Each die has 1 and 6 on opposing faces & 2 and 5 on the other faces</li>
                <li>There are no graces or extra throws</li>
                <li>The pieces start on specific square instead of the charkoni although captured pieces are returned to the charkoni <br>
                To prepare to start the game, position each set of four pieces on squares 6, 7, 23 and 24</li>
                <li>A throw cannot be passed in whole part or unless a player cannot move.</li>
                <li>Each throw can be split into its constituent parts and shared across the pieces</li>
                <li>Conglomerate pieces move using the throw of the dice as if they were single piece</li>
                <li>A double piece can only be captured by a double, triple or quadruple piece, a triple piece is only <br>
                vulnerable to a triple or quadruple pieces and a quadruple piece can only be captured by another quadruple piece. </li>
                <li>An exact throw is required for a piece to get home</li>
            </ul>
