                I am a curious person who loves to play different types of games. <br>
                One of which is Chaupar that I played for the very first time when I was 10 years old. <br>
                When my grandfather teach me about this game and also the history of this game. <br>
                This game was quite hard to learn in the starting but that makes it more interesting and Now I love it very much. <br>
                Therefore, when I got assignment about an non-electronic game then I don't think twice and select this game. <br>
