            <em>
                Chaupar/Chopad/Chaupad 
            </em>
            is a kind of board game which was famous in India; during the ancient times. 
             <br> During the time of Britishers they introduced Ludo as the 
            most modern version of this game around the year 1950. 
            <br> The original Chausar is made with the help of the cloth or the wool, used to have wooden pawns <br>
            and seven cowry shells that will be used to determine move of the each player in the game. Nowadays, <br>
             it also come made with the help of the
            wood instead of the cloth or wool. <br>

            This game requires quite skills as during the game the opposite component usually try to mislead their 
            <br>
            components in order to win this game.
            The best thing about this game is that it requires your all focus, patience and ability to play.
